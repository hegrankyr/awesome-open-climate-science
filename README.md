This is a curated list of open source software pacakges that  make our lives as scientists, hackers and data wranglers easier or just more awesome.
This list is intended to be the fluid-earth counterpart of
[awesome open geoscience](https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience),
although there is inevitably some overlap.
**It is not just climate science!** We use the word "climate" in the repo name just as shorthand for the fluid part of the earth.
Packages from atmospheric science, oceanography, climate science, and hydrology are all welcome.

In accordance with the [awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md),
we add awesome repositories. We are wide open to [contributions](contributing.md) of course!
Don't hesitate to add your favorite packages by making a [pull request]

## Software
Awesome software projects sub-categorized by focus.

### General Purpose

While packages are not technically specific to AOCH science, they are so essential for scientific workflows that we can't not include them.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) Data structures and computational tools for working with tabular datasets
- [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) Data structures and computational tools for multidimensional arrays, inspired by netCDF data model

### Frameworks

- Iris
- CDMS

### Meteorology

- [MetPy](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) Collection of tools for reading, visualizing, and performing calculations with weather data.
- [windspharm](https://ajdawson.github.io/windspharm/index.html) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) Spherical harmonic wind analysis

### Oceanography

- [GSW-Python](https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Python) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) Thermodynamic equation of state for seawater.

### Climate

- [climlab](https://climlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) Process-oriented climate modeling

### Spatiotemporal Statistics

- [EOFs](https://ajdawson.github.io/eofs/) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) EOF analysis

### Regridding

- [xESMF](https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - ![Python](media/icon/python.png) Regridding for numpy and Xarray datasets based on the Earth Systems Modeling Framework (ESMF) library

### Data Storage

- netCDF
- HDF
- Zarr
- xmitgcm

### Simulation

- Do we list all the open source climate model codes? Are they awesome enough?

### Visualization
